Pyrate
======

Optical Design with Python.

To use the core package with standard management and optimization code
write your source file and import the modules from the core subdirectory.
Use the demo_*.py files as a starting point for your investigations.
It is also possible to use FreeCAD as a 3D interface. Mainly the implementation uses
wrapper codes to wrap the core functionality in a dialog and click & play manner.
There is still no lens editor interface. At the moment you can only choose some demo
directly in the sources.

FreeCAD workbench
=================

- copy (or symlink) the pyrate directory into ~/.FreeCAD/Mod
- execute ./build_rc in PyrateWorkbench directory
- choose workbench in FreeCAD
