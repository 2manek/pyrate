Pyrate
======

Optical Design with Python.

FreeCAD workbench
=================

- copy (or symlink) directory PyrateWorkbench into ~/.FreeCAD/Mod
- execute ./build_rc in PyrateWorkbench directory
- choose workbench in FreeCAD
- at the moment you have to create symlinks of all core .py files in the PyrateWorkbench directory (is there any better solution to this problem?)
