# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to pyrate. 

We love to receive contributions from our community - you! 
There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, 
submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which 
can be incorporated into pyrate itself.

If you communicate with others be respectful and open minded.

# Responsibilities

For providing any contributions:

 * Ensure that code does not break at least the demos 
 * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
 * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
 * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# When filing an issue 

Make sure to answer these three questions:

 1. What did you do?
 2. What did you expect to see?
 3. What did you see instead?
